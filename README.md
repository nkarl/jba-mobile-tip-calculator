# [JBA-MOBILE] Taking baby-steps toward mobile development
In this project, I will be learning the very basics of developing a simple mobile app on Android via Android studio.

I will work on this project concurrently with the Web-Developer track, with a stronger focus on the other track.

That being said, this will be a good starting point to get practical experience on how to develop a mobile app for Android with the areas of knowledge pertaining to it, i.e. application layout and widgets and UI components.  This is also a great opportunity to see async in action via event listeners.

## Description
Tipping is a way to show your satisfaction and gratitude for the service you get.  However, it's a pain in the neck to calculate the amount of tip, so let's create a handy tool that will make it easier!


## Learning Outcomes
I will get to know the basics of Android development such as application layout and widgets and events.  The final application will calculate the tip amount based on the bill and the tip percentage.
